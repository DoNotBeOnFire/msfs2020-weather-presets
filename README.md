Weather presets for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020

Download the repo as a [ZIP file](https://github.com/DoNotBeOnFire/msfs2020-weather-presets/archive/main.zip) (or click the green "Code" button"), unpack and then copy **only** the included folder `dnbof-weather-presets-pack` into the Community folder of the sim. Start the sim and the new presets should appear on the weather presets list.
