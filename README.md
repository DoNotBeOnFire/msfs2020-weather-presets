# Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 - Weather presets

Weather presets for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020

Download the repo as a [ZIP file](https://github.com/DoNotBeOnFire/msfs2020-weather-presets/archive/main.zip) (or click the green "Code" button"), unpack and then copy **only** the included folder `dnbof-weather-presets-pack` into the Community folder of the sim. Start the sim and the new presets should appear on the weather presets list.

## Atmospheric
- Large but scattered clouds with light winds
- Touch of aerosol density for drama
- Great for screenshots especially if used around sunrise/sunset

## Convective Day
- Medium sized Cumulus clouds, with cloud base at 8000ft AMSL
- South-westerly 12 knots wind, no gusts
- Great for soaring in a glider for ridge flight (modify wind direction in the preset to suit ridge orientation).
- If using a tool like Kinetic Assistant to add thermals, set the thermal top altitude to 8000ft AMSL to match the visuals (or modify all three cloud bases of the preset to match your thermal top)
